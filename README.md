Project Description

This is a Java-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game using Swing for GUI rendering. The game features animated sprites, randomized pipe generation, gravity-based bird movement, scoring logic, and collision detection. The simple interface and real-time mechanics make it a fun and educational project to understand Java graphics, event handling, and basic game loop design.
